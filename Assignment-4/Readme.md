# MNIST Dimensionality Reduction and Classification

This repository provides a theoretical overview of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction on the MNIST dataset, followed by the implementation of classifiers (Logistic Regression and Neural Network) to recognize handwritten digits. The impact of dimensionality reduction on classifier performance is evaluated.

## Overview

Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental technique in machine learning used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving the most important information. PCA is one of the most widely used dimensionality reduction techniques. In this project, we aim to understand the theoretical underpinnings of PCA, its application to the MNIST dataset, and its impact on classifier performance.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Introduction

PCA is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by transforming the original features into a new set of orthogonal features called principal components. The principal components are ordered in such a way that the first principal component explains the maximum variance in the data, followed by the second principal component, and so on.

### Steps of PCA

1. **Standardization**: The features of the dataset are standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to ensure that all features contribute equally to the PCA.

2. **Compute Covariance Matrix**: The covariance matrix of the standardized dataset is computed. The covariance matrix represents the relationships between the different features.

3. **Compute Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**: The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are computed. Eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance in the data, while eigenvalues represent the magnitude of variance along these directions.

4. **Select Principal Components**: The eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are selected as the principal components.

5. **Transform Data**: The original dataset is transformed into the new feature space spanned by the selected principal components.

### Variance Explained

The variance explained by each principal component indicates the amount of information retained by that component. By selecting a subset of principal components that collectively explain a high percentage of the total variance, we can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving most of its information.

## Classification

### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a linear classification algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using the logistic function. In this project, we apply logistic regression to classify the digits in the MNIST dataset.

### Neural Network

A Neural Network is a powerful machine learning model composed of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons). It can learn complex patterns and relationships in data. In this project, we design a simple neural network architecture for digit classification, with an input layer matching the number of PCA components, at least one hidden layer, and an output layer with 10 units corresponding to the 10-digit classes.

## Performance Evaluation

Performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the performance of classifiers on the test dataset. We compare the performance of the classifiers trained on the original high-dimensional data with those trained on the PCA-reduced data to understand the impact of dimensionality reduction on classifier performance.

## Conclusion

Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of classifiers by reducing the computational complexity and memory requirements. However, the choice of the number of components and its impact on classifier performance should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the requirements of the task.
