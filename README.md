**Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing expenditures on insured customers for an insurance company using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to forecast the financial outlay incurred by the insurance company on these customers based on various demographic and lifestyle factors. The dataset comprises profiles of insured clients, including information such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking status, region, and medical expenses.
**Tasks Overview**
**Data Preprocessing:**
Load the dataset and handle any missing values by removing corresponding rows.
Encode categorical variables such as gender, smoking status, and region into numerical values suitable for regression analysis.
Normalize the features using Min-Max scaling to ensure uniformity in the range of values.
**Splitting the Data:**
Divide the data into "features" and "target" subsets.
Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance.
**Gradient Descent Implementation:**
Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch to find the regression line.
Experiment with both constant and decaying learning rates, recording loss values for each iteration.
Show coefficients and intercept of the model obtained through gradient descent.
**Model Evaluation:**
Predict medical expenses for the testing dataset using the trained model.
Compute Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess prediction accuracy.
Visualize the error distribution using a histogram.
**Learning Rate Analysis:**
Analyze the effect of varying learning rates on the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm.
**Scikit-learn Implementation:**
Utilize the linear_model.LinearRegression class from scikit-learn to repeat the regression.
Compute MAE and MSE for comparison with the custom implementation.
**Normal Equation Implementation:**
Implement the normal equation method to find the regression line directly.
Compare the MAE and MSE with previous methods to assess performance.
**Comparison:**
Compare the three solutions in terms of MAE, MSE, and computational efficiency to identify the most effectiveÂ approach.
